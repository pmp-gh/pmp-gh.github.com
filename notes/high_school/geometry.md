### Angles

* Angles formed when a transversal intersects two parallel lines  
  Corresponding angles are equal: $a=e,d=h,b=f,c=g$  
  Alternate interior angles are equal: $d=f, c=e$  
  Interior angles are supplementary $c+f=180^\circ, d+e=180^\circ$  
  Vertical angles are equal: $a=c, b=d, e=g, f=h$  

### Triangles
* Theorem: The sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$.
* Theorem: Exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of its remote interior angles.
* Tests of Congruence: SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS (in congruent triangles, **CPCTC**)
* In an isosceles $\triangle$ ABC: If AB = AC, then $\angle B = \angle C$ (converse also true).
* In an isosceles $\triangle$ ABC: If AB = AC, the perpendicular from A to BC bisects BC.
* In an isosceles $\triangle$ ABC: If AB = AC, the bisector of BC that passes through A is perpendicular to BC.
* Theorem (Pythagoras): In right $\triangle$ ACB ($C=90^\circ$), $AC^2 + CB^2 = AB^2$.
* 30-60-90 Triangle: If side opposite 30 is s, side opposite 90 is 2s, side opposite 60 is $\sqrt3$s.
* 45-45-90 Triangle: If the legs are s, the hypotenuse is $\sqrt2$s.
* Heron's Formula: If a, b, c are sides of a triangle, s is semi-perimeter, its area is $\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$.
* In any triangle, the longest side is opposite the largest angle, and the smallest side is opposite the smallest.
* Triangle Inequality: The sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third.
* In $\triangle$ ABC, C is acute iff $AB^2 \lt AC^2 + BC^2$; C is obtuse iff $AB^2 \gt AC^2 + BC^2$.

### Similarity

* Corresponding angles in similar figures are equal, ratio of corresponding sides is the same.
* If $\triangle$ ABC $\sim$ $\triangle$ DEF, A=D, B=E, C=F, $\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{BC}{EF}=\frac{CA}{FD}$.
* Tests of Triangle Similarity: AA, SAS, SSS.
* Parallel and perpendicular lines are clues to look for similar triangles (see figure for common setups)
* If two triangles are similar such that the sides of the larger triangle are $k$ times the smaller triangle,  
  the area of the larger triangle is $k^2$ times that of the smaller triangle.
